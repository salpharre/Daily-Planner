### General Info

A daily scheduler to save events or todos. Type in what the event in the empty text area and push `Save`. Closed the tab by accident? Don't worry, as long as you clicked `Save`, your todos will still be there when you re-open the page! Want to delete something? Make sure to hit `Save`!

Timeblocks are color-coded to reflect whether the event is current, past or future. This feature was achieved using moment.js.
